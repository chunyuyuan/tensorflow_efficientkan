# tensorflow_efficientkan for "An Efficient Implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network"

This repository contains an tensorflow version of "an efficient implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)".
The original implementation of KAN is available [here]([https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan](https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan)).

This implemention is to apply tensorflow to re-cover the pytorch version of Efficient kan.  The experiemnt on mnist can also be 97%, which has similar performance with original pytorch version.
